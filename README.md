# typescript_express_basic

This repository is meant to get me started on understanding typescript better and starting on NodeJS Typescript project. The next repository will cover react side. This is primarily focused on nodeJS Express with Typescript!

There are 3 parts to my learning
1. Basic typescript with nodeJS express (Login flow)
2. Decorators
3. Advanced express and TS decorators

- `Part 1 Tutorial` : Express and Typescript to implement a basic login page
- `Part 2 Tutorial` : Decorators
-  `Part 3 Tutorial` : Advanced concept, Express with TS integration -> controllers, decorators etc!
